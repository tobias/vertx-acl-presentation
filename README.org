* Introduction to Vert.x presentation

  This is a presentation I gave at
  http://www.meetup.com/Asheville-Coders-League/ on 24-July-2013. You
  can view the rendered slides at
  http://tcrawley.org/presentations/vertx-acl/vertx.html.

** Sample app

   To run the sample app:
   1) [[https://bintray.com/vertx/downloads/distribution/2.0.0-final][install Vert.x]]
   2) =vertx/bin= to your path 
   3) =cd sample-app/=
   4) =vertx run bridge_server.js=
   5) point a browser at [[http://localhost:8081/]]

   In my demo, I used the Clojure verticle instead (=app.clj=), but
   using that requires manually installing the [[https://github.com/vert-x/mod-lang-clojure/][Clojure module]]. Give
   that a shot if you're feeling froggy.
